# Building the next-gen Web, and why "Web3" isn't the solution as long as it uses Blockchain

As engineers, we are trained to build responsibly and always think of the societal & environmental impacts of our work. It's our duty to ensure we serve the population responsibly and ethically. So, when thinking of what the next generation of the Web will look like, we need to build responsibly to ensure a safe & inclusive web for everyone whilst not destroying our planet. 

There've been lots of talks about a next-generation web that gives power back to the users by letting them own & control their own data. You might've heard of "Web3" which is a term used to define this next-gen Web, however the term is very deeply associated with crypto/blockchain. I'm not the only one to believe that the mission of "Web3" can be achieved without using blockchain, and there are very good reasons why. In this post I'll dive deep into this whole topic and hope to share some of what I've learned. 

## Is there a problem with the current Web? 

First of all, let's have some definitions. When I say the Web, I mean the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web).

# Building the next-gen Web 

You all heard of the "Web 1 is read-only, Web 2 is read-write, Web 3 is read-write-own". According to this definition our mainstream web is currently at Web 2, while there is lots of money being poured in to building Web 3. 

First of all, let me just say that these Web1/Web2/Web3 definitions are in no way standardized definitions. Web 1 and Web 2 make sense, there was a big paradigm shift from mostly-static websites to webapps run by big tech and unicorns. So I understand these 2 definitions so far. But the definition of "Web 3" starts to get a bit fuzzy, and it's different depending on who you ask.

When I first started reading about Web 3, my first impression was that it would be a next-generation web that'd give power back to the users; by letting users own & control their own data on the web. I was very excited about this! There are a lot of negative downsides of big tech owning our data (see below section), and I also had the same idea earlier of wanting to build a new something that'd let users own/control their own data when using webapps. So I was very excited to learn more about Web 3, only to be disappointed very quickly as I soon came to realize that "Web3" is very deeply associated with cryptocurrencies & blockchain. Sounds weird right?! Why would we need cryptos/blockchain to allow users to own/control their own data on the Web?? What does blockchain have to do with this?? 

Nevertheless, I kept an open mind as I believed in the mission of Web 3 to allow users to own/control their own data. I thought that maybe we can move the solution from using blockchain. But again, I came to realize more and more just how deeply this association of "Web3" and blockchain is - if you say "Web3", everyone thinks of the blockchain solution, not anything else. It just *has* to be the blockchain solution otherwise it's not web3. Anyway, I found Stephen Dhiel's blog and read this post which I loved, highly recommend his blog. This post linked to the Solid Project led by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web. 

Solid is something I can get behind, I truly believe in what they are doing, and I believe it is the right way to move forward for sure.
