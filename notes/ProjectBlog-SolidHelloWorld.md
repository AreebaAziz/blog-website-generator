# Hello World Solid App (Solid tutorial)

I will be building my first Hello World Solid app today. To get started I will follow this guide on Solid's website: https://solidproject.org/developers/tutorials/getting-started

This is the tutorial for building the actual app: https://solidproject.org/developers/tutorials/first-app

1. Create Solid Pod and WebID.

I created a Solid Pod with [Inrupt Pod Spaces](https://start.inrupt.com/profile). 

My WebID is: https://id.inrupt.com/areeba

2. Install `npm`

I already have `npm` installed. My version is `8.1.0`

3. Initialize the application

```bash
mkdir Solid-HelloWorld
cd !:1
npm init --yes
```

4. Install Inrupt client libraries

```bash
npm install @inrupt/solid-client @inrupt/solid-client-authn-browser @inrupt/vocab-common-rdf
```
